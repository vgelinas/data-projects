It is around the corner from Ossington Subway station and Christie Pits Park and walking distance to everything you could need/want! It has real wood floors, all new stainless-steel kitchen appliances, ornamental fireplace, luxury bathroom, 10ft high ceilings, and exposed red brick walls. Enjoy a stay in the heart of the City and in the centre of some of Toronto's popular neighbourhoods. This suite layout and organization is suitable for one person or a couple and is not suitable for children. I set up the space to preserve the views between the bay windows at the front of the house and the bay windows at the back of the house, choosing to divide the space with french doors to maintain the ability to enjoy the largeness of the space the way the architect originally intended back in 1886. This suite is perfect for anyone who needs monthly accommodation while working in Toronto for a few months, or if you need a home w*hile looking for a long term lease, or if you simply want to enjoy the convenience of a furnished apartment for one to six months. Many of my guests have been people who have transferred to Toronto for work or contract or a course and need short term accommodation. High speed internet and utilities are included, and you will enjoy en-suite laundry. The bathroom was just renovated, and I installed all new stainless appliances in the kitchen, including a dishwasher (I used to live in the suite myself). There is a back porch over the garden which you can access from the kitchen. I now live on the floor above and am happy to provide guidance for newcomers to Toronto! Because I live on-site and have asthma, strictly no smoking or vaping of any substance on the property or burning of any substance (i.e. no incense) and no plug-in air fresheners or similar products are allowed, and absolutely no pets, no matter how cute! This is a residential area where people have families, including my wonderful neighbours. If you're looking for a place to party or have people over late at night, please look elsewhere. We follow a policy of being mindful of limiting any loud activities from around 10:30pm to 8:30 am so that everyone gets a good night's sleep and hope that you would like the same : )",1886,None

Residents living here enjoy the great ethnic diversity and services in nearby establishments. This location is ideal for \""car-free\"" residents due to the close proximity to the Donlands subway stop. A must mention of this property is just how convenient students find using the Donlands train station to access the St George train stop where the University of Toronto's main St George Campus and The Annex area intersect. For those with vehicles, street parking is allowed with City Street Permit.\n\n Location Details  \n\nThe Danforth, Toronto's Greektown, juggles east-enders' enviro-chic, vegan-friendly sensibilities with the city's biggest celebration of meat on a skewer; otherwise, know as the Taste of the Danforth. Carrot Common is the central meeting point here and home to the ever-popular The Big Carrot. But venturing east and west along the main drag yields some great finds like the restored Danforth Music Hall, shopping at Lustre and Bullet and great eats at Globe, 7 Numbers and Athens Pastries. blogto.com\n\n  To schedule a tour  \n\nWe now book our tour appointments online!
